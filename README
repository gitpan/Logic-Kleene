NAME
    Logic::Kleene - Kleene three-valued logic

REQUIREMENTS
    This module requires Perl 5.6.0 or newer. Only core modules are used.

INSTALLATION
    Installation can be done using the traditional Makefile.PL or the newer
    Build.PL method .

    Using Makefile.PL:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make test
      make install

    (On Windows platforms you should use nmake instead.)

    Using Build.PL (if you have Moddule::Build installed):

      perl Build.PL
      perl Build test
      perl Build install    

    You may see warnings about undefined values during testing. This is
    normal.

SYNOPSIS
      use Logic::Kleene;

      $a = !kleene( somefunction() );

      if ($a && $b) { ... } 

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements Kleene three-valued logic via overloading.

    The third value is between true and false, and is equivalent to an
    undefined value (as when a program has not yet returned a value).

    The significant different is that the negation of an undefined value is
    still undefined (and so treated as false). For example,

      my $status = kleene(somefunction());
      if (!$status) {
        print "somefunction failed";
      }

    If the status value is false, then it will print the failure message, as
    expected. But if the status is undefined, then it will not print the
    message.
