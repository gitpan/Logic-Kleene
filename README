NAME
    logic::kleene - Kleene three-valued logic

SYNOPSIS
      use logic::kleene;

      $a = !kleene::logic->new( somefunction() );

      if ($a && $b) { ... } 

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements Kleene three-valued logic via overloading.

    The third value is between true and false, and is equivalent to an
    undefined value (as when a program has not yet returned a value).
